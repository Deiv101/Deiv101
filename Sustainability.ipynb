        "\n",
        "Based on the survey data analysis, five key sustainability themes were identified:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Awareness and Knowledge Gap\n",
        "\n",
        "The data reveals a significant knowledge gap regarding the materials used in synthetic hair products and available recycling options. Most respondents are unaware of the materials used in synthetic hair production and recycling options for synthetic hair. Very few have researched the environmental impacts of synthetic hair products. This lack of awareness represents a major barrier to sustainable practices in wig usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2 Disposal Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "The vast majority of respondents dispose of synthetic hair in general waste bins, with very few using recycling bins. This indicates that synthetic hair products predominantly end up in landfills, contributing to environmental waste. The data suggests a lack of proper disposal infrastructure or knowledge about appropriate disposal methods for synthetic hair products.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.3 Interest in Sustainable Alternatives\n",
        "\n",
        "There is significant interest in biodegradable alternatives, with many respondents willing to consider them, especially depending on factors like cost and style. However, actual usage of biodegradable options is very low, primarily due to lack of awareness and availability issues. This indicates a gap between interest and access to sustainable alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.4 Economic Considerations in Sustainability\n",
        "\n",
        "Economic factors play a significant role in sustainability decisions. While some respondents would definitely pay more for environmentally sustainable materials, many indicated their decision would depend on factors like cost. Similarly, there's hesitancy to pay for recycling services. This suggests that cost is a significant barrier to adopting sustainable practices in wig usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.5 Support for Sustainability Initiatives\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the knowledge gaps and economic considerations, there is strong support for sustainability initiatives, with most respondents willing to support initiatives aimed at improving the sustainability of synthetic hair products. This indicates a positive attitude toward sustainability that could be leveraged to promote more sustainable practices in the industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Research Hypotheses\n",

        "\n",
        "**Results**: Third-party certification increased purchase probability by 37% compared to uncertified products, with participants willing to pay an average premium of 18% for third-party certified products.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications**: Certifications significantly influence purchasing decisions, with stronger effects for third-party verification, suggesting the development of credible certification standards could be effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.6 Combined Interventions (H14)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research Methodology**: A community-based intervention study across four neighborhoods, each receiving different interventions: awareness campaign only, economic incentives only, increased product availability only, or all three combined.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Results**: The combined intervention neighborhood showed a 47% increase in sustainable practices, which was significantly higher than the sum of individual effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications**: Combined interventions have synergistic effects, suggesting stakeholders should coordinate efforts rather than pursuing isolated strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Visualizations of Potential Results\n",
